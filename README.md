flapibrew
===========

flapibrew is the attempt to create a tornado based web app that
controls [Ardumashtun](https://github.com/beercanlah/ardumashtun), a
recirculating mashtun build by Nick Lewty and Markus Baden.

You can find
[more info about the recirculating mash tun](http://beercanlah.com/?page_id=49)
on the blog [beercanlah.com](http://beercanlah.com/).

Currently this is still work in progress. The main development is in
the yun branch, which works with a recent version of the yun based
sketch found in [Ardumashtun](https://github.com/beercanlah/ardumashtun).
